# RootMe-TryHackMe-via-Bash
A good practice for bash scripting language. This mini project gains user shell by execute the .sh file. Everything the user needs to know, will appear after the execution of the script.

You need the reverse_shell.php file from here ( https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php ) and change the IP Address to your Attacker Machine IP.

### USAGE
```
chmod +x rootme.sh

./rootme.sh
```
